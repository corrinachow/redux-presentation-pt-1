1. **Predictable state**.
   - If the same state and action are passed to a reducer, the same result is always produced as reducers are pure functions.
   - State is immutable. If you mutate either input or output you invalidate the state.
   - Time travel, move back and forth among the previous states and view the results in real-time.
2. **Centralised state handling**
3. **Debuggable for days**
   Redux makes it easy to debug an application. By logging actions and state, it is easy to understand coding errors, network errors and other forms of bugs that might come up during production.
4. **Ease of testing**
   It is easy to test Redux apps because reducers are pure functions
5. **Hot module reloading**: allows you to replace pieces of code as you make edits

## Summary

- Redux allows for predictactable data flow and component architechture, making understanding, developing, and debugging and application easier, and consistent
