1. Predictable state updates
2. Centralised state handling
3. Time-travel debugging allows devs to step back and forth in history of dispatched actions, see the state and UI at each point in time, and even alter history by cancelling actions
4. Hot module reloading: allows you to replace pieces of code as you make edits. When React components are sweapped, they lose their internal state. Keeping app state allows you to live-editt components while keeping all data in tact

## Summary

- Redux allows for predictactable data flow and component architechture, making understanding, developing, and debugging and application easier, and consistent
