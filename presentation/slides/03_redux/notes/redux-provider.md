Redux can be used with any UI layer (such as Angular, Vue, or plain JS), but is most commonly used with React. The official React-Redux package provides bindings between React and Redux.

The <Provider /> makes the Redux store available to any nested components.

Since any React component in a React Redux app can be connected, most applications will render a <Provider> at the top level, with the entire appâ€™s component tree inside of it.
