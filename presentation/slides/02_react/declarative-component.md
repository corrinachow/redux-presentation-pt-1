**Declarative**:

- Never interact with DOM
- The UI is updated when the state (or descriptions of the UI) changes

**Component based**: has encapsulated components that manage their own state, then compose them to make complex UIs

- Since it's written in javascript instead of templates, you can pass rich data through your app and keep them out of the DOM
